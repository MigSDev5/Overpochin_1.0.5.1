DaRT Ban Relay Server v1.0

You only need to use this if you are having problems with Ban requests in DaRT. (Cut off, not working at all, slow, unreliable, ...)
Server will use your RCon password to protect your ban list from unauthorized requests.

Follow the steps below for proper installation.
1. Copy the BRS.exe into your BattlEye directory
2. Confirm that your bans.txt and your beserver*.cfg are in the same directory as the BRS.exe
3. Start the batch file included in the zip (You can also use a shortcut and set the -port parameter)
4. Turn the Ban Relay Server on in the DaRT settings
5. Try it out

Remember that BRS needs to run on the same port as your DayZ/Arma server or it won't work.
